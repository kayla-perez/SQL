#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
select count(orderID)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderID)=6
and orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
select count(quantity)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where product='iPhone'
and length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
select acctnum 
from BIT_DB.customers c
join BIT_DB.FebSales fs
on c.order_id=fs.orderid
where length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
select product, Min(price)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderid)=6
and orderid <>'Order ID'
group by product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select product,quantity,SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
and orderid <>'Order ID'
and length(orderid)=6;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select count(distinct c.acctnum),avg(quantity*price) as spent
from BIT_DB.FebSales fs
join BIT_DB.customers c
on fs.orderid=c.order_id
where quantity>2
and length(orderid)=6
and orderid<>'Order ID';
